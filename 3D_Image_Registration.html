         Histopathology is considered the gold standard for diagnosing many diseases, including cancer. It relies on the visual examination of tissue samples, typically prepared through serial sectioning, which reveals the tissue architecture and its various structural components.
<br>The aim of this project is to align multi-colored whole slide (WSI) images for 3D reconstruction. 
After reviewing state-of-the-art methods in the field of WSI registration, the work consists in developing a model capable of estimating transform to be applied to regions of interest (ROI), such as tumor regions or any other structure in the tissue, by investigating optimal transport. 
      
A key objective is to maintain the geometric integrity of the reconstructed object: its volume and shape should be preserved. For example, a sphere must not be distorted into a cylinder.
