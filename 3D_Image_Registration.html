          In image processing, <strong>shape skeletonization</strong> is the reduction of a 2D or 3D object to a thin, centered representation, known as its skeleton or medial axis, that preserves the object’s topology and geometry, thereby simplifying analysis and processing.
Recently, CNN based models achieve significant performance improvement compare to classical algorithms. 

<br>This work has two main objectives:
   <ul> <li> first, conduct a comprehensive survey of existing methods for shape skeletonization, covering both classical approaches (e.g., morphological, geometric, and graph-based techniques) and more recent machine learning–based methods. 
     </li>
     <li>Second, implement a deep learning approach for 2D shape skeletonization. Particular attention should be given to the robustness of skeleton extraction in the presence of noise or irregularities in the input shapes, as this remains a critical challenge in practical applications.
</li>
</ul>
