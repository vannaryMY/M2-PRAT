            Many methods to recognize structures in images, need many data to train these methods. However these data are sometimes rare, in particular for thin structures such as blood vessels or nerves in medical imaging, which are difficult to image. The aim of this project is to build synthetic images based on the description of such structures and their spatial relations to other structures.

<Strong>Work:</Strong>
<ul>
<li> 1. Literature review on the modeling of spatial relations and the design of spatial configurations</li> 
<li> 2. Implementation of a method to draw lines and thin objects in an image, satisfying required relations to other objects (typically organs for applications in medical imaging).
