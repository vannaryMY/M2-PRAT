        Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a framework for synthesizing MRI images of the developing brain with dilated ventricles of variable shapes.

Description
Ventricular dilatation in infants may require surgical intervention to prevent secondary damage to the developing brain. Monitoring ventricular size with MRI holds promise for improving these critical clinical decisions. Neuroimaging has advanced significantly thanks to the growing field of computational imaging. However, due to the high variability at early ages and the small size of paediatric cohorts, automated segmentation of paediatric radiological images remains less developed compared to adult imaging. In neonates, ventricular segmentation has been performed using U-Net models, and synthetic datasets have been used to simulate disease on MRI.

Method

This project builds on a generative artificial intelligence model that synthesizes MRI scans of the developing brain with ventricular dilatation. The goal is to further develop this model to evaluate the feasibility of varying the shapes of the dilated ventricles and simulating increasing degrees of dilatation.

Interactions with a medical expert is planned during the project
